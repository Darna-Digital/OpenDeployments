# About

OpenDeploys aims to help application developers to deploy their apps in a secure and scalable way.

While there're many solutions that already help you do that, here's where OpenDeploys differ:

- It's not a PaaS platform. You don't pay to use it.
- It doesn't require an install on your server.
- It works directly in your CI/CD and connects with your infrastructure.
- It's platform and provider agnostic.
- It's fully open source.
