# About

OpenDeploys aims to help application developers to deploy their apps in a secure and scalable way.

While there are many solutions that already help you do that, here's where OpenDeploys differ:

- It's not a PaaS platform. You don't pay to use it.
- It doesn't require an installation on your server as it's not an application.
- It works directly in your CI/CD and connects with your infrastructure.
- It's platform and provider-agnostic.
- It's fully open source.

## FAQ

#### What is IAC?

Infrastructure as code is a way to declaratively configure infrastructure through a programming language instead of manually configuring it in a dashboard.

#### Why would I use OpenDeployments instead of SST Console?

OpenDeployments provides guides for running SST in a CI/CD. There's not much material online on how to do this as SST makes money through their open core product called Console that solves the deployment part.

The reality is that most teams already use either GitLab or GitHub, so it makes sense to configure infrastructure deployments there instead of using an additional tool. This is where OpenDeployments come in.

#### What cloud providers does OpenDeployments currently support?

AWS and Cloudflare. We're interested in adding more, so if you have any requests feel free to add them in: [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/orgs/Darna-Digital/discussions)
