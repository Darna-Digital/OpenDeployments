# About

OpenDeploys aims to help application developers to deploy their apps in a secure and scalable way.

While there are many solutions that already help you do that, here's where OpenDeploys differ:

- It's not a PaaS platform. You don't pay to use it.
- It doesn't require an installation on your server as it's not an application.
- It works directly in your CI/CD and connects with your infrastructure.
- It's platform and provider-agnostic.
- It's fully open source.

## FAQ

#### What is IAC?

Infrastructure as code is a way to declaratetively confiure infrastrucure through a programming language instead of manually configuring it in a dashboard.

#### Why would I use OpenDeployments instead of SST Console?

OpenDeployments is optimised for running in CI/CD pipelines. Most teams host their code in GitHub or GitLab.
Running deployments there is more convenient as prevents you from needing extra setup and tools.

#### What cloud providers does OpenDeployments currently support?

AWS and Cloudflare. We're interested in adding more, so if you have any requests feel free to add them in: [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/orgs/Darna-Digital/discussions)
