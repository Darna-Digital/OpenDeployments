# Cloudflare IAC

## Use Cloudflare with Infrastructure As Code

To manage DNS records and other Cloudflare services programmatically, you'll need to set up API credentials. With the API access you will be able to connect your domain to your AWS infrastructure. So for example if your application is on 123.cloudfront.net, with Cloudflare IAC you will be able to connect that domain to your domain.com

## Prerequisites

- A Cloudflare account
- At least one domain added to Cloudflare
- Domain must be using Cloudflare nameservers

## Getting API Token

### Step 1: Create an API Token

1. Log in to the [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
2. Go to **My Profile** â†’ **API Tokens**
3. Click **Create Token**
4. Choose **Edit Zone DNS**
5. Choose DNS zones and domains you want to manage.
