# AWS IAC

## Configuring AWS

To deploy and manage infrastructure on AWS, you'll need to set up AWS credentials with programmatic access. This involves creating an IAM user with the necessary permissions and obtaining AWS Access Keys.

<Steps>

    ### Log in to your AWS Console

    Go to [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) and sign in with your account.

    ### Go to IAM (Identity and Access Management)

    Navigate to IAM from the AWS services menu or search for "IAM" in the search bar.

    ### Navigate to "Users" in the left sidebar

    In the IAM dashboard, click on "Users" from the left navigation menu.

    ### Select or create a user

    Either select an existing user or create a new one by clicking "Create user".

    ### Attach security policies for this user

    To do that, go to:

    - IAM â†’ Policies
    - Create a new policy

    <Callout type="info">
        Use a dedicated IAM user with minimal required permissions for your application resources. This will depend on the infrastructure your app requires.

        If you don't know the exact resources your app will need, you can start with with a permissive option, and later add more protections once you have your CI/CD going.

    </Callout>

    ### Configure access keys

    Under the "Security credentials" tab:

    For a new user: Click "Create access key"
    For an existing user: Click "Create access key" in the "Access keys" section

    When you create the access key:

    - The **AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID** is the "Access key ID"
    - The **AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY** is the "Secret access key"

    <Callout type="warning">
        **Security notes:**
        <div>
            - Make sure to save these credentials immediately when they're shown - the
            secret access key cannot be retrieved again after initial creation
        </div>

        <div>
            - Never commit these credentials to your repository as they could be visible
            in the Git history later on
        </div>

    </Callout>

</Steps>
