# AWS IAC

## Use AWS with Infrastructure As Code

To deploy and manage infrastructure on AWS, you'll need to set up AWS credentials with programmatic access. This involves creating an IAM user with the necessary permissions and obtaining AWS Access Keys.
Having an IAM user will allow you to provision infrastructure through code. So instead of configuring the AWS dashboard manually, you will specify what you need in code.

## Prerequisites

- An AWS account
- Administrative access to create IAM users and policies

## Step 1: Create an IAM User

1. Sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/)
2. Navigate to **IAM** (Identity and Access Management)
3. In the left sidebar, click **Users**
4. Click **Create user**
5. Enter a username (e.g., `terraform-user` or `iac-deployment-user`)
6. Select **Programmatic access** for access type
7. Click **Next: Permissions**

## Step 2: Attach Policies

For infrastructure management, you'll need appropriate permissions. Choose one of the following approaches:

### Option A: Full Administrative Access (Simplest)

- Attach the **AdministratorAccess** policy
- ⚠️ **Warning**: This grants full access to your AWS account. Only use for development/testing.

### Option B: Custom Policy (Recommended for Production)

Create a custom policy with only the permissions your infrastructure needs:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:*",
        "s3:*",
        "lambda:*",
        "iam:*",
        "cloudformation:*",
        "route53:*",
        "acm:*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Step 3: Get Your Access Keys

1. Click **Next: Tags** (optional)
2. Click **Next: Review**
3. Click **Create user**
4. **Important**: Copy both the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**
5. Store these securely - the secret key will not be shown again
